# <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>
# 010B45DH	Your Hardware Vendor
#
# Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor>
# is the name of the vendor. The prefix must have a length of 8 hex 
# digits. This makes it easier to filter the correct entry.
#
# The order of entries in this file are not important.
#
# If a manufacturer can already be assigned during the arp-scan, entries 
# in this file have no relevance. However, if the Mac address in question 
# cannot be assigned to a manufacturer using the arp-scan vendor database,
# this file can be used for assignment.
