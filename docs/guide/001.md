# Discreet buttons and menus
<!--- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

Within the web interface, there are some discrete buttons that provide access to relevant pages.

![Guide_002][Guide_002] 

The "**1**" button (ðŸŸ¥) opens a drop-down menu with the following functions/pages
- "Auto Page Reload (2min)" - If the checkbox is activated, the browser reloads the current page every 2 minutes.
- "Internet" opens the detailed view of the "Internet" device
- "Show Notifications" opens the Reports page. The number of reports is indicated by the red counter in the top right-hand corner.
- "Sign Out" logs out the browser and redirects to the login page. If no password protection is activated, this button has no function.
- The bottom 3 buttons are links to Github, Github Sponsors and to my homepage, where I provide an archive and changelogs of past Pi.Alert versions.

The area marked "**2**"(ðŸŸ¦) leads to the System Info page. This page can also be opened from the Settings page via the blue "i" icon in the status box


### System info page

![Guide_003][Guide_003]

The System Info page collects various information from the system itself, from the Pi.Alert configuration file and from data from Pi.Alert satellites 
(if this function is used). In addition, it is possible to shut down or restart the system on which Pi.Alert is installed.


### Reports page

![Guide_004][Guide_004]

All notifications are displayed on this page by default. If this is not wanted, it must be deactivated in the configuration file in the following 
section by changing "True" to "False".

```
# WebGUI Reporting
# ----------------------
REPORT_WEBGUI        = True
REPORT_WEBGUI_WEBMON = True
REPORT_TO_ARCHIVE    = 12
# Number of hours after which a report is moved to the archive. The value 0 disables the feature
```

If notifications should no longer be counted as a red badge at the top right, but messages may still need to be kept, they can be moved to an 
archive either manually or automatically after a certain number of hours

In addition to the individual "Delete" button, each report also has a button to download the report as a PDF. The color of the heading of a report depends on the "module" that triggers 
the report (System Event, Device Scan, Web Service Monitoring, ICMP Monitoring)
