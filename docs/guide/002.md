Now we come to the settings page. This page is divided into 4 sections.

![Guide_005][Guide_005] 

### Section "**1**" (ðŸŸ¥)

This status box provides a basic overview of the current status of Pi.Alert.

Here you will find the time at which the database was last changed and the current size of the database. Please note that the 
database is not only changed at the start or end of a scan, but also during such a scan, which can take several minutes depending on 
the complexity. Changes to the device details or entries in the journal also influence this timestamp.

You will also find the counters for the created database and configuration backups.

The "Scan Status" should help you to recognize when the next scan starts and whether a scan is already running. The countdown 
displayed here simply counts down the 5 minutes until the cronjob starts the next scan. If you change the interval in the cronjob, 
this countdown will not adjust.

The "Auto-Backup" status indicates whether the function is activated and, if this is the case, whether the function is currently paused 
or waiting for a scan to be completed in order to perform the backup. This waiting for a scan to finish is necessary in order to prevent 
the backup from being corrupted.

The two colors used for "Notifications" indicate which notifications are active (green) or inactive (red).

The "Ignore list" field shows all Mac addresses or Mac address parts that are ignored during the scan, i.e. that are neither recognized 
as "New" nor as "Online".

### Section "**2**" (ðŸŸ¦)

This section provides access to the various logs that are generated in Pi.Alert.

### Section "**3**" (ðŸŸ©)

In addition to section 4, this section contains the actual settings. This area is further divided into 4 subsections and, if the "Satellite" function is activated, into 5 further subsections:
- Settings (activation/deactivation of scan modules, security settings, pausing scans)
- GUI (themes, languages, device list columns, editor for predefined filters) 
- Maintenance (database maintenance tasks)
- Data backup
- Satellites (creation and management of satellites)

### Section "**4**" (ðŸŸª)

Here you can edit the pialert.conf file. You can look up an overview of the parameters on the "Help / FAQ" page (*Explanations for the file "pialert.conf"*) in Pi.Alert.
